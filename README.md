# CS114
## Anthony


Most Likely my most in depth project that I've done yet at NJIT. This was a semester long chat application created in CS114. It uses client/server sockets to communicate data and allows for seamless IRC chatting. All UI and Backend features were done over the course of that semester and implemented by me. This was a really in depth Java project that involved the from the ground up programming of several different files and the implementation of many different optional features.

Languages: Java
